Overview
This project aims to build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Using a dataset containing transactions made by credit cards, the goal is to identify transactions that are likely fraudulent.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset. It contains transactions made by European cardholders over two days in September 2013. The dataset includes 284,807 transactions, with 492 being fraudulent (0.172% of all transactions).

Features
Time: Number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
V1-V28: Principal components obtained with PCA to protect user identities and sensitive features.
Amount: Transaction amount.
Class: 1 for fraudulent transactions, 0 otherwise.
Requirements
Python 3.8+
Jupyter Notebook
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Imbalanced-learn
Installation
Clone the repository:
sh
Copy code

Data Preprocessing
Load Data: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Data Cleaning: Check for and handle missing values.
Feature Scaling: Standardize the Amount feature.
Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets.
Resampling: Use techniques like SMOTE to handle class imbalance.
Modeling
Several machine learning models are tested for fraud detection, including:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
XGBoost
Evaluation
Models are evaluated using the following metrics:

Precision
Recall
F1-Score
ROC-AUC
Results
The best performing model based on the evaluation metrics is saved for future predictions. Detailed results and comparisons of different models are provided in the results/model_evaluation.txt file.

Usage
Ensure the virtual environment is activated.
Run the Jupyter notebook to see the analysis and modeling steps:
sh
Copy code
jupyter notebook notebooks/analysis.ipynb
Use the trained model to make predictions on new data by importing the model and preprocessing scripts from the src directory.
